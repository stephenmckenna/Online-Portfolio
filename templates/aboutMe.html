        Hello! My name is Stephen McKenna, a senior Computer Science student at the<br>
        University of Pittsburgh. In the future, I hope to work with autonomous vehicles<br>
        as a Full-Stack Engineer. This website is for me to present the work I have accomplished<br>
        thus far in my career in technology. Here you'll find information about my education<br>
        and past job experience, as well as a list of numerous projects I have completed<br>
        both academically and recreationally.
